# Tutorials

C++ will always be my first love. I started learning programming with this language, and it feels extremely comfortable for me to use. So, today, we'll take a look at one of my first projects.

### candymachine.cpp

This is a candy dispenser program in C++. The candy machine will sell a user candy, chips, gum, or cookies. This blog post will be a little less specific so you can go through the code and try to understand it yourself.

We have a CashRegister and DispenserType Class. The CashRegister will hold the cash, and the DispenserType will hold the snacks. 

The program will show the user the different snack being sold, let them choose how many they want, and also compare the number of snacks selected by the user with how many snacks are in stock.

The user can then input some money so they can buy their snacks.

In the CashRegister class, we have declared a constructor that that will set the amount of money in the register to 500. The other functions getCurrentBalance() and acceptAmount will be returning the amount of money in the register and also changing the amount of money in the register according to how much money the customer gives.

The DispenserType Class will also have a constructor declared that will set the cost of the item to 50. The functions getNoOfItems(), getCost(), and makeSale() will be involved with returning the number of items, the cost, and updating the number of items in the dispenser.
In the int main() we call on the functions that will show the snacks and then perform the sale.
Letâ€™s take a look at sellProduct().

In this function, we ask the user for the number of products they want, create the objects from our classes, and call on the functions from our classes to perform our sale.
