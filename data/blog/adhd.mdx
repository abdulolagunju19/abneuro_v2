Welcome to another awesome blog post! This is a term paper I recently wrote about ADHD.

### Quote of the Post:

> "Given their automatic tuning out, ADD children forever find themselves being told to “pay attention”—a demand that completely misunderstands both the nature of the child and the nature of attention. The obvious monetary connotation of “pay” is that attention is something the child owes the adult, that the child’s attention belongs to the adult by right. The phrase takes for granted that being attentive is always a consciously chosen act, subject to one’s will. Both of these assumptions are faulty." - Gabor Maté

### Introduction

#### A Case Study on the Failures of Current ADHD Treatments

A 12-year-old girl was brought to her doctor with her mother complaining of poor
academic performance and concentration in class (1). As cases of attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) were identified in her family tree, she was prescribed with a drug called
Adderall. For the following month, the girl reported to her doctor that she no longer had
problems with inattention. Her mother proudly reported that her grades were significantly higher.
Things were looking much better. Unfortunately, one week later this girl suffered from an anxiety
attack. She struggled with visual hallucinations, psychomotor retardation, and maintaining
proper hygiene. This girl had gone through amphetamine-induced psychosis due to her usage
of Adderall (1). Her ADHD diagnosis resulted in prescription of a drug that left her incoherent
and unstable.

ADHD is a disease of impulsivity. The prevalence of ADHD worldwide ranges from 2.2 to
17.8% (2). ADHD patients have a host of other comorbidities, such as higher risk of vehicular
accidents due to increased impulsivity levels. Currently, pharmaceutical drugs used to treat
ADHD fail to serve as a long-term solution, despite their short-term efficacy (3). In addition, 30%
of ADHD patients cannot tolerate the side effects of their ADHD drugs. Current drug treatments
for ADHD have an abundance of risk factors and fail to change detrimental long-term outcomes
for ADHD patients (4). The chilling experience undergone by this girl illustrates this point. It is of
the utmost importance that ADHD patients understand how best to manage their symptoms
given the myriad of risks associated with ADHD. Most ADHD drugs target the central nervous
system; however, dysregulation of the endocrine and immune system also affect ADHD
phenotypic behaviours. Ironically, physicians have been unable to control their own impulses in
prescribing powerful drugs like Adderall in order to treat ADHD. This needs to change. By
harnessing the power of neural, endocrine, and immunomodulatory interactions, researchers
can give ADHD patients better and more effective ways to manage their symptoms.

### SECTION 1: A Traditional Understanding of ADHD

#### 1.1 – What is ADHD?

ADHD has a diverse range of manifestations (5). It is considered a disorder of
neurodevelopment. ADHD patients suffer from impulsive behaviour, hyperactivity, and struggle
with excess levels of inattention. Symptoms are often diagnosed at a young age in patients.
Patients with ADHD may struggle achieving high marks in school and performing well in their
careers. ADHD patients may also struggle in social situations due to their predisposition towards
impulsive behaviour. 

A population-based survey showed that most male ADHD patients were diagnosed at
12, whereas females were diagnosed most frequently at the age of 16 (6). 64% of ADHD
patients also had another condition, most commonly anxiety disorders. 62% of children in the
U.S. with ADHD in 2016 were taking medication. 23 billion dollars are spent in the U.S. every
year on treating ADHD, and it is estimated that between 38 and 72 billion dollars are lost due to
ADHD associated reduced productivity. ADHD is a disease with clear social and economical
ramifications for individuals and society.

#### 1.2 – Etiology and Pathophysiology of ADHD

The etiology of ADHD is complex. Research has indicated ADHD is hereditary (1, 2).
Different genes play important roles in ADHD pathology. These include genes encoding cell
migration, neural development, and dopamine transporters/receptors (5, 7). There are several
environmental factors associated with higher risk of ADHD. They include heavy metal exposure
and pesticide exposure. Moreover, environmental factors such as nutritional deficiencies,
maternal alcohol consumption, and exposure to viral infections play a role in ADHD pathology
(5, 22).

Regardless of this previous research, the causes of ADHD are still not fully understood.
Several mechanisms have been proposed. Many ADHD studies focus on the role of
dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic signaling (7). In addition, structural changes in
the brain have been associated with ADHD (8). Traditional research into ADHD focuses on the
role of neurotransmitters in the brain, brain volume differences, and genetic studies (5).
Unfortunately, as ADHD is a clinical diagnosis, there is a lack of standardization in ADHD
research. This can make it difficult to answer mechanistic questions concerning ADHD disease
pathology.

Research into the brain has still uncovered patterns concerning ADHD pathophysiology.
An MRI neuroimaging study, a mega-analysis, revealed subcortical brain volume differences
among ADHD patients (8). There were 1713 ADHD patients and 1529 controls. Researchers
observed significantly smaller volumes in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate nucleus,
hippocampus, and putamen when comparing ADHD patients to controls. The largest difference
was found in the amygdala. Problems with the amygdala are associated with the emotional
difficulties that ADHD patients face, such as reduced emotional reactions to stimuli that provide
satisfaction. These results have pushed forward the interpretation of ADHD as primarily a
disorder of the brain. ADHD was also associated with a 3% decrease in global brain volume (9).
Moreover, there was no association with stimulant medication and changes in brain volume
among ADHD patients (8). Treatments for ADHD are failing to result in global brain changes and long-term solutions for ADHD patients (8). Nonetheless, the focus in ADHD research has
been on the role of the central nervous system, and the immune and endocrine system have
been neglected.

#### 1.3 - Current Treatment Strategies for ADHD 

The major form of treatment for ADHD patients involves stimulant and non-stimulant
pharmaceuticals (5). Behavioural treatments are also common. As dopaminergic signaling plays
a large role in ADHD, medications affect dopamine release or reuptake. Most ADHD drugs
increase the availability of dopamine. Unfortunately, ADHD drugs have a myriad of side effects,
including a decrease in appetite, changes in blood pressure, and an increased risk of drug
dependency. Psychosocial and behavioural treatments are available, but research indicates that
medication currently provides more efficacious outcomes. ADHD research currently focuses on
the neural aspects of the disease but overlook the importance of neuro-endocrine and neuroimmune interactions.
Moreover, the random control trials used to establish the safety and efficacy of ADHD
drugs fail to account for patients with higher severity of ADHD symptoms (10). This leads to
worse clinical outcomes for these patients using ADHD drugs. In addition, there is a lack of
evidence supporting the safety of long-term use of ADHD medications. ADHD patients have
misconceptions about the safety of their medications. For example, ADHD stimulant medication
has a significant association with psychotic disorders. Moreover, ADHD medications require
prescriptions, and compliance from ADHD patients is poor (around 64%) (11). Another study
found that the attitudes common among parents of patients with ADHD include the belief that
ADHD medications have adverse side effects (12). The public has a clear distrust of the safety
of ADHD drugs.

A research survey indicated that 71% of ADHD patients suffer from side effects, ranging
from sleep problems to loss of appetite. Common medications for ADHD include stimulants
such as amphetamine and methylphenidate (13, 14). When high dosages of methylphenidate
were administered to young male rats, this led to increases in mitochondrial superoxide
production in the cerebellum (14). Superoxide is a reactive oxygen species. It leads to further
increases in the production of central nervous system proinflammatory cytokines. The activation
of immune cells and increases in inflammation may play a role in ADHD-related side effects.
More research still needs to be performed to answer the mechanistic questions concerning
methylphenidate and its side effects on the body.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is often also used to treat ADHD. Cognitive behavioural
therapy for adult Chinese ADHD patients resulted in significant improvements in impulsivity levels (15). In addition, a meta-analysis revealed that cognitive behavioral therapy results in
significant improvements of ADHD symptoms (16). Cognitive behavioural therapy provides an
alternative method for treating ADHD. Other therapies may be viable and effective, but further
research involving immune and endocrine associated ADHD mechanisms in these therapies are
currently lacking. Using medication to treat ADHD relies on interactions between psychiatrists,
pharmacists, and several other health care practitioners to treat the disease (5). This, along with
the costs of medication, make treating ADHD expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, patient
noncompliance with medications is commonplace, and the public is beginning to mistrust ADHD
drugs due to dangerous side-effects. This over-reliance on treating ADHD with drugs must
come to an end. A new paradigm involving neuro-endo-immunomodulation (NEIM) for treating
ADHD is required to rebuild trust with the public, provide better long-term outcomes for ADHD
patients, and reduce costs for the health-care system (5).

### SECTION 2: A NEIM Approach to ADHD

#### 2.1 – Preliminary Evidence for NEIM Interactions in ADHD

Research indicates that the neural, immune, and endocrine systems all play a role in
ADHD. Researchers used spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), a rodent ADHD model, to
study immune and endocrine influences in ADHD development (7). Due to the predisposition of
males to ADHD, male rats were used in this study. To determine cytokine expression, ELISA
experiments were performed. In addition, immunohistochemical methods were performed in
order to learn about neurochemical alterations. Juvenile ADHD model rats had significantly
higher levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin 1-beta (Figure 1) in addition to
oxidative stress markers. Mature ADHD model rats had elevated serum and adrenal levels of
hormones such as cortisol. ADHD rats had lower medial prefrontal cortex volumes in addition to
higher expression of dopamine receptors. This study shows that it is possible to study ADHD
from a NEIM perspective. In animal models, the immune and endocrine system may play a role
in ADHD pathogenesis, in addition to neural circuitry. For the rest of this review, further research
indicating the interactions between the neural, endocrine, and immune system will be
highlighted.

#### 2.2 – Stress and the HPA Axis in ADHD

ADHD involves the activity of several physiological systems. This includes the endocrine
and immune system. The endocrine system involves the secretion of hormones, and the
hypothalamic pituitary axis plays a large role in this process. The Hypothalamic Pituitary Axis
(HPA) is extremely important for the regulation of homeostasis. The hypothalamus secretes
corticotropin releasing hormone, which stimulates adrenocorticotropin hormone release from the pituitary, which in turn stimulates the secretion of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. Stress
activates the adrenocortical response, leading to the secretion of glucocorticoids by the adrenal
cortex.

In a longitudinal study focusing on Dutch adolescents from the ages of 11 to 19, DSM based
ADHD, anxiety, and depression values were collected (17). In addition, other questionnaires
collected data based on stress exposure. Trajectories were then modeled. Results showed
stress exposure levels were higher in the ADHD subgroups. ADHD patients that were exposed
to lower levels of stress over time also had higher remission rates of ADHD. However, this study
only shows correlations and fails to take into account the mechanisms that result in an
association of higher stress levels and ADHD. Nevertheless, it shows that chronically high
stress levels may play a role in the persistence of ADHD.

High levels of stress exposure affect the body’s ability to secrete glucocorticoids. A study
found that ADHD Chinese male children had significantly lower plasma cortisol levels when
compared to controls (18). This suggests that HPA axis dysfunction plays a role in ADHD. If
patients have an impaired ability to secrete glucocorticoids, they will struggle with dealing with
stressful situations. This lack of cortisol in addition to increased stress exposure levels may lead
to a vicious cycle of stress in ADHD patients, leading to the development or exacerbation of
ADHD symptoms. Glucocorticoids also play a role in learning, memory, and attention, which are
affected in subjects with ADHD. Cortisol also plays an important role in the body by limiting the
severity of the stress response. A lack of cortisol may contribute to a reduced ability of cortisol
to prevent increased stress levels from compromising homeostatic processes. 

Another cohort of patients with ADHD also had lower salivary cortisol levels when
compared to age and sex matched controls (19). In addition, injecting high levels of cortisol in
pregnant rats resulted in offspring displaying behavioural characteristics similar to those of
ADHD animal models (20). This reveals that dysfunction of the HPA axis may play a role in the
development of ADHD. More research into hormones and endocrine signaling in ADHD may
reveal why ADHD patients exhibit these physiological differences. This research provides a
rationale for the importance of treating the HPA axis and limiting stress in patients with ADHD. 

#### 2.3 – The Immune System in ADHD

There are studies linking the role of the endocrine system in ADHD pathogenesis, however,
what role does the immune system play? It is evident that there is a great deal of interactions
between the immune and endocrine system. When exposed to pathogens, the immune system
is activated. Immune cells produce cytokines and other mediators of inflammation. These
molecules also act at the pituitary and hypothalamus to trigger release of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticotropin releasing hormone, respectively. These molecules trigger the release
of glucocorticoids by the adrenal cortex. Glucocorticoids act to reduce the severity of the
immune response. To maintain homeostasis, glucocorticoids play an important role in the
immune and stress response. The presence of glucocorticoids acts as a buffer, preventing the
overactivity or over suppression of the immune response. As previous evidence indicates the
glucocorticoid production is disrupted among patients with ADHD, this may also lead to
disruptions in the immune system. Indeed, research indicates that an overactive immune
system may play a role in ADHD pathogenesis.

Behavioural and psychiatric disorders such as ADHD can often occur as a result of
autoimmune disease. Autoimmune disorders occur due to inappropriate activation of the
inflammatory system. An overactivation of the inflammatory system can result in damage to an
organism’s cells by the very mechanisms meant to preserve homeostasis. Autoimmunity can
result in damage to endocrine glands and neuronal structures. Many autoimmune disorders are
associated with ADHD (21). Patients with autoimmune disorders such as arthritis juvenilis and
autoimmune thyroiditis have a higher risk of ADHD. Maternal autoimmune diseases are also
associated with ADHD. In children with a family history of autoimmune disorders such as type 1
diabetes and psoriasis, they have an increased risk of ADHD. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is due to
the T cell mediated destruction of beta islet cells of the pancreas. It is an example of how
increased pro-inflammatory activity may be involved in ADHD pathogenesis. Moreover, another
prospective nation-wide (Norway) study showed that mothers with ADHD offspring had higher
rates of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and rheumatoid
arthritis (22). Other autoimmune disorders with a profound inflammatory component such as
type 2 diabetes showed no association with ADHD. More research is required in order to learn
more about the specific autoimmune mechanisms involved in disorders such as T1D that may
increase ADHD risk. These results provide a clear association between autoimmune disorders
and ADHD, implicating the immune system in ADHD pathogenesis.

Additionally, ADHD children have significantly increased levels of auto-antibodies to the
Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (23). This study indicates the antibodies may serve as
biomarkers for autoimmunity in ADHD. The cerebellum plays a role in attentional learning and
the regulation of emotions and is closely involved with the basal ganglia and the prefrontal
cortex, other regions implicated in ADHD by volumetric imaging studies (23). Auto-antibodies to
the dopamine transporter were higher among ADHD patients (24). Antibodies represent a way
for the immune and neural systems to interact. As ADHD is considered a neurobehavioral disease, it is important to understand how the immune system may affect the brains of ADHD
patients. 

Another study also found that children with ADHD have significantly higher serum levels
of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, when compared to controls (25). IL-6 may be
involved in the mediation of inflammatory signals in ADHD. When the immune system mounts a
response against peripheral endotoxins, IL-6 release is mediated by hypothalamic neurons. IL-6
is also released by microglia, and it is pro-phagocytotic, so it may be a possible mechanism for
demyelination and a loss of white matter in ADHD. This evidence shows how neuro-immune
communication may be involved in ADHD pathogenesis. Targeting increased inflammation or
autoimmune mechanisms may be another viable way to limit the severity of ADHD in patients.

#### 2.4 – Dopaminergic/Noradrenergic Signaling in ADHD

Dopamine also plays a significant role in regulating homeostasis, and dopaminergic
signaling is impaired in ADHD (26). Immune cells produce dopamine in order to communicate
with neural circuits. Dopamine is involved with the activation of immune cells, and as previously
discussed, ADHD is associated with autoimmune disorders. Many studies have shown that
ADHD is associated with mutations to the human dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene (27).
These mutations result in reduced dopaminergic signaling. A prospective longitudinal study in
male adolescents revealed there is a significant association between the DAT1 genotype and
exposure to prenatal smoke. Prenatal smoke exposure is an environmental risk factor for
ADHD. Moreover, the striatum of males shows greater dopamine receptor density when
compared to females, and this may be a reason why males are more vulnerable to ADHD (28).
Sexual dimorphisms often indicate the presence of endocrine related signaling, further
highlighting the importance of exploring endocrine mechanisms in ADHD pathology.

Researchers used positron emission tomography to measure dopamine transporters and
receptors (29). ADHD patients had lower specific binding of neural cells in the dopamine reward
pathway in the left side of the brain. The dopamine reward pathway is the meso-accumbens
dopamine pathway. The major site activated by rewards is the nucleus accumbens, and the
midbrain is also involved in motivation circuity. ADHD patients had less D2/D3 receptors in
addition to less dopamine transporter availability. An inattention phenotype may be due to a
reduction in synaptic markers for dopamine in patients with ADHD. This study shows that
without sufficient dopamine signaling, ADHD patients may struggle with overcoming their
attentional deficits without pharmacological support. Moreover, children and adolescents show
significant differences in the dopaminergic property of their midbrain nuclei when compared to
controls (30). It is likely that impaired dopaminergic signaling in the brain plays a significant role in ADHD. In addition, animal models of ADHD involving spontaneously hypertensive rats
indicate downregulation of dopamine receptors in the brain contributes to ADHD (31).
Increasing the availability of dopamine is the primary way that medications treat ADHD.
Nevertheless, there are other mechanisms that may play a role in ADHD pathology, and the
heavy involvement of dopamine in the immune system indicate that by intervening in these
mechanisms, new therapeutic benefits may be available for patients with ADHD.

Dopamine is not the only neurotransmitter that plays a role in ADHD (32). Reductions in
norepinephrine signaling are associated with ADHD. The locus coeruleus is the major source of
norepinephrine in the brain. The locus coeruleus is involved in regulating working memory and
sending norepinephrine projections to the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is responsible
for executive functions, many of which are impaired in patients with ADHD (32). Moreover,
stress results in the activation of the locus coeruleus. Norepinephrine plays a significant role in
the activation of the stress system. Norepinephrine transmission is reduced in patients with
ADHD (32). Normally, norepinephrine decreases the activity of the prefrontal cortex in response
to sensory stimuli. This has been hypothesized to result in better focus and attention levels.
Atomoxetine has been used to treat ADHD (33). Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine transporter
inhibitor. Norepinephrine transporters increase the clearance of norepinephrine released at the
synapse. Blocking norepinephrine transporters increases the neurotransmission of
norepinephrine. In rats, atomoxetine blocks depletion of norepinephrine (32). Norepinephrine
concentrations in the prefrontal cortex were increased by atomoxetine. These increases in
norepinephrine signaling improve the stress response and attentional awareness. Dopamine
and noradrenergic signaling both play an important role in ADHD pathophysiology and thus are
the target for most pharmaceutical drugs for ADHD. 

#### 2.5 – The Gut Microbiome in ADHD:

Gut bacteria modulate neurotransmitter levels. Therefore, they may also play a role in
ADHD pathology. Researchers have collected fecal samples from patients with ADHD and
controls and found significant differences in some bacteria (34). The Ruminococcaceae genus
was abundant in patients with ADHD. Other research has shown the Ruminococcaceae genus
is prevalent in individuals with autism, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. These bacteria degrade
cellulose, converting it to short chain fatty acids. These chemicals cause free fatty acid
receptors to be activated and allow microglia to develop into a neuroprotective phenotype. Short
chain fatty acids can act systemically or locally and modulate neuronal functioning via
autonomic and sensory innervation in the gut. Pathogenic gut bacteria can also increase
systemic inflammation in the body, contribute to leaky gut syndrome, and alter the phenotype of microglia to become more toxic. When ADHD gut bacteria are introduced to mice, anxiety
behaviors are more likely to be observed (34). Early studies show the gut microbiome plays a
role in ADHD. However, the exact mechanisms in which these bacteria affect the neural,
endocrine, and immune systems remains unknown.

Gut bacteria are involved in the production of precursors for important neurotransmitters
like serotonin and dopamine (35). Researchers characterized the gut bacteria of ADHD patients
using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, learning that ADHD patients had significantly higher
numbers of Bifidobacterium when compared to controls. Researchers also discovered higher
levels of an enzyme called cyclohexadienyl dehydratase in ADHD patients. Cyclohexadienyl
dehydratase is involved in the generation of phenylalanine, a precursor of dopamine.
Bifidobacterium levels were associated with the increases in the levels of this enzyme. Further
research is required to understand the mechanisms in which Bifidobacterium contribute to
ADHD pathology. Nevertheless, these studies indicate these specific bacteria in the gut may be
involved in the dysregulation of dopaminergic signaling.

In addition, researchers used an SHR ADHD rat model to study inflammation and
microglial function (36). A healthy gut microbiome is essential for the proper development of
microglia. They found that Iba1 (marker for microglia) expression was higher among ADHD rats
when compared to controls. Dysfunction of the gut microbiome may be related to dysregulation
of microglia pruning and increased activation of microglia. SHR rats have limitations, including
increases in dopamine/norepinephrine as rats age, leading to decreased ADHD symptoms.
Further animal models for ADHD are required in order to further validate these results.
Nevertheless, researchers measured the brains of human ADHD patients and controls using
PET imaging. They found that patients with ADHD had increased numbers of activated
microglia in the orbito-frontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when compared with controls.
The activation of these microglia was associated with increased inattention among ADHD
patients. As short chain fatty acid production from gut bacteria modulates microglial
development, the gut microbiome may play a role in the activation of microglia in ADHD. These
studies provide evidence that dysfunction of the gut microbiome is involved with ADHD
pathogenesis.

#### 2.6 - NEIM Therapies and ADHD:

Finding better ways to treat ADHD patients is crucial. Parents for children with ADHD had
significantly higher levels of anxiety, perceived stress, and reported physical health problems at
a higher frequency when compared to controls (37). In addition, they had higher levels of C-reactive protein, a marker for inflammation. Finding ways to reduce the severity of ADHD
symptoms can benefit both the quality of their lives and their caregiver’s lives. 

Yoga results in changes to gene expression that protect cells from injury. Furthermore,
evidence suggests that yoga inhibits the chronic activation of glucocorticoid pathways via the
HPA axis. Dementia caregivers undergo a lot of stress . Nevertheless, 8 weeks of yogic
mediation caused circulating leukocytes to reduce their expression of metastasis and proinflammatory related genes among dementia caregivers. This provides evidence that yoga is
involved in physiological pathways that reduce stress. A study found a significant improvement
in ADHD symptoms after an average of 8 yoga training sessions were given to children
diagnosed with ADHD (38). Other studies have shown that treatment of ADHD using yoga and
medications stabilize ADHD symptoms.

Traditional Chinese medicines such as acupuncture and Tai chi were found to be as
effective as methylphenidate in ADHD treatment for short durations of time. Unfortunately, the
studies were not of a rigorous methodological standard, and more studies are required to fully
validate this claim. A Tai Chi study involving undergraduate ADHD students did show that
retention rates were high, indicating the patients with ADHD will adhere to this form of treatment
(39). In other tai chi studies, teachers reported that ADHD symptoms improved among subjects
following a 5-week tai chi course (40). Whether these changes are long-term or result in
plasticity induced changes to the brain remains to be answered. Moreover, a study involving
ADHD rats (Adult male SHR) showed improvements in spatial learning ability after 30 minutes
per day of treadmill exercise (41). Young men with symptoms of ADHD reported reduced
feelings of depression, and increased motivation for cognitive tasks following cycling (42).
Physical activities such as yoga, tai chi, and exercise are affordable and high compliance, and
may be a possible way of alleviating the symptoms of ADHD. 

Researchers also placed children diagnosed with ADHD on a specific hypoallergenic
diet (43). Foods containing milk, eggs, artificial preservatives, and gluten were excluded in
addition to other substances. ADHD symptoms were found to be correlated with carbohydrate
intake, and the diet modification program improved ADHD symptoms. Changing a patient’s diet
may be a promising therapeutic avenue for patients with ADHD. Dietary supplementation of
vitamin D may be another possible means of improving ADHD symptoms. Children with ADHD
expressed significantly lower levels of serum vitamin D when compared to controls (44). A
deficiency in vitamin D has been found to be associated with a dysfunctional immune system
and increased antibody production. The food that individuals consume affect the function of their
gut bacteria. More research needs to be performed in order to learn more about the nutritional factors that affect ADHD and how dietary changes may attenuate symptoms of ADHD. More
studies are required to address the gaps of knowledge involving controlling inflammation and
oxidative stress involved in ADHD, and the dysregulation of the HPA axis. Nevertheless, yoga,
tai chi, exercise, and dietary changes may provide alternatives to classic pharmacological
treatments for ADHD. 

### Conclusion: NEIM offers an Alternative Way to Treat ADHD

ADHD is not a one-dimensional disease. It involves the interaction between several
different systems in the human body. To better help ADHD patients, researchers must be
prepared to broaden their traditional understanding of the pathophysiology of ADHD. The
nervous system is key to understanding ADHD pathophysiology, as evidenced by the
widespread use of stimulants in treating ADHD. Unfortunately, current drugs are too expensive
and have too many adverse side effects. Caregivers and ADHD patients distrust these
therapies. Regulating stress, inflammation associated with autoimmunity, and gut microbiomes
may provide previously unknown therapeutic benefits for ADHD patients. More animal models
and clinical trials with ADHD patients need to be performed that involve other avenues such as
mind body therapy and dietary changes. By introducing activities that have less side effects
such as yoga and exercise, or are significantly cheaper than drugs, such as dietary changes,
ADHD patients will pay less and suffer less for their treatments. The body relies on the systemic
harmony of the endocrine, neural, and immune system. ADHD treatments should reflect this
paradigm.

Figure 1. Adapted from Kozłowska A et al. (2019). 5-week-old (juvenile) and 10-weekold (mature) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs, ADHD animal model) and Wistar
Kyoto rats (WKYs, control animals). Juvenile SHR rats express significantly higher levels of serum interleukin (IL)-1β compared to controls. Mature SHR rats express significantly higher levels of serum interleukin (IL)-6 compared to controls. Results are from ELISA experiments, and the units are pg/mL. P < 0.5 indicates significance.
